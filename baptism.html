    <h2 style="color:red">1.What is baptism?</h2>
    
    
    <p>The word <i>"baptise"</i> comes from a greek term <i>"to dip"</i> under water. When Jesus was baptized,he was immersed in the Jordan River and then he came <b>"up out of the water"</b><span style="color:blue">(Mark 1:9,10)</span> Similarly,true christians are baptized by being fully dipped,or immersed in water.</p>

   <h2 style="color:red">2.What does baptism show?</h2> 
    
    
    By getting baptized,a person shows that he has dedicated himself to Jehovah God. How does a person make a dedication? Prior to baptism,in a private prayer, he tells Jehovah that he wants to serve him forever. He promises to worship only Jehovah and to make the doings of God's will the most important thing in his life. He chooses to <b>"disown himself and ... keep following"</b> Jesus' teachings and example.<span style="color:blue">(Matthew 16:24) </span> His dedication and baptism make it possible for him to have a close friendship with Jehovah and with fellow whorshippers.
